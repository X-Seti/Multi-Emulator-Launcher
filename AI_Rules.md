## Instructions to Give Claude at the Start of Every New Chat

--- simplified
Important rules to remember: Project name is Multi Emulator Launcher

1. To avoid confusion, the file must include #this belongs in [dir]/ [filename] or goes in root /[filename] - Version: [number] updates to file. Keep the existing file header comments. "X-Seti - $MONTH$DATE 2025 -" rest of the header information.

Example:
# X-Seti - August 14 2025 - Multi Emulator Launcher - COL Table Population Methods.

"""
COL Table Population Methods - Handles populating the main table widget with COL file data.
"""

List all def functions in alphabetical order, and class sections, for example:

##Methods list -
# _load_col_file
# _populate_col_table_enhanced
# _setup_col_tab
# setup_col_tab_integration
# _setup_col_table_structure
# _update_col_info_bar_enhanced
# _validate_col_file

##class COLParser: -
#__init__
# def log
# _is_multi_model_archive

Each method gets its own #vers [number]. Increase the version number so we can keep track of method changes.

Example:
def validate_col_file(main_window, file_path): #vers 1

2. The header's file name [filename] must match the saved file. Keep filenames simple and unchanged. Avoid using words like
   "Enhanced",
   "Fallback",
   "Improved",
   "Fixed",
   "Fix",
   "Patch",
   "Patched",
   "Updated",
   "Integrated",
   "Clean"
Anywhere in the file, filename, method or functions. This will avoid confusion and file function duplication. Each set of related functions has its own file.

3. Shared functions go in methods/
Themes .json files go in themes/
Core important /single-use functions go in core/
Editors go in components/
and GUI-related functions go in gui/

4. No emojis, only SVG-generated icons. Only exception is DP5 Workshop.py where we use emojis in paint session.

5. "CRITICAL: When fixing bugs, you must preserve 100% of the original functionality. Do not simplify. Also, check the original file first before creating a fix or update.

6. No patch files; check for duplicate functions and give a warning, suggest removal of duplicates, consolidate functions that can be shared and placed into the methods/ folder.

7. No patch or quick fix files! - Lots of patch files can make it hard to find problems; each file should have a simple name indicating its functions.

8. On the "Continue" prompt,  only make edits to complete the script.

9. Keep all replies short and to the point, as we have limited data on our pay plan. "Important"

10. No Conflicts: Keep track of functions in the project files. No duplicate functions. Check existing files and functions first before creating newer functions.

11.  No fallback code - Works or doesn't work - no middle ground

12. Always ask first before creating files or suggesting ideas, but let me decide.

13. Read the Changelog file. List of TODO and functions fixed, comnents /big changes goes in the changelog.

14. Finally, use the sed command to make small changes to files. Instead of recreating the file, be mindful of bandwidth and session limits.

15. For large fixes, show the full fixed method; just tell me the file to swap the method.

16. No long explanations anywhere — not in chat replies, not in code comments, not in changelog entries, not in summary files. State what changed, nothing more. Word caps in rule 17 apply everywhere, including chat replies.

17. I have limited bandwidth, so keep replies short and to the point. Comments for methods: 12 words or less; notations in code: 10 words or less; changelog /todo entries should be 30 words or less.

18. No guessing; check that you have access to GitHub repos or ask for the files first, before anything else is done. And confirm this with me.

19. Bugs are shown in the root/bugs folder; these are the issues we always fix first. Once done and tested, update the changelog.

20. Workshop layout (COL Workshop is the reference). Main file keeps only __init__, settings, docking, help, theme, tabs.

21. Other methods go into depends/ mixin classes, one job per file: <tool>_win_func, <tool>_setup_ui_func, <tool>_core_logic_func, <tool>_list_func, <tool>_paint_func, <tool>_viewport.

22. Mixins come first in the class bases, before Qt and shared mixins. Mixins never import the main workshop file.

23. Each file keeps an alphabetical methods list per class, updated when methods move.

24. Splitters use methods/grip_splitter.py GripSplitter; sizes saved to the tool's config json; list pane default 220px.

25. Text buttons go icon-only when space is short: methods/imgfactory_ui_settings.apply_compact_buttons. Every icon button has a tooltip.

26. Test standalone and docked: every button and action clicked, no exceptions. Then sync the standalone repo.

## Workflow
- Clone the repo first; confirm access before any work
- Use the Claudia token to push directly to GitHub
- Syntax-check Python files before pushing: python3 -c "import ast; ast.parse(open('file.py').read()); print('OK')"
- sed for small fixes, full method shown for large fixes
- Always pull before push to avoid conflicts
- Confirm the plan with the user before making changes
- Keep replies short, no walls of text
- No artefacts, no summary files - changes go straight to GitHub
